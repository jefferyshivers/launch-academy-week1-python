# Launch Academy Week 1, but in Python

This is the Python implementation of some object-oriented challenges from the Launch Academy core curriculum.

I'm using Python 3.6 for these exercises, so it's possible that some things here may not be compatible with Python 2.*.

Here is a breakdown of what I used to develop each exercise (only listing the *new* stuff, so it's cumulative):

- **person constructor**: Classes, instance methods, conditionals, string interpolation, `split` and `join`, ternary.
- **circle constructor**: dictionaries, dictionary key lookups, type checking, `filter`.
- **geometric classes**: the `unittest` module
